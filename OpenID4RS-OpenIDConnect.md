# OpenID4RS-OpenIDConnect

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol,
which allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on
the authentication performed by an authorization server.

This document provides a detailed exploration of the use of OpenID Connect
in the context of the Research and Scholarship context.

## 1. Introduction

# OpenID4RS-OpenIDConnect

This document delves into the specifics of how OpenID Connect
is implemented in the OpenID4RS context. Topics such as the various
endpoints involved, the flow of authentication, user attributes, and the
cryptographic algorithms used are discussed. Additional areas covered
include the management of logs and the process of revocation

The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how OpenID Connect
facilitates secure and seamless communication between various entities in
the Research and Scholarship ecosystem. This document should be read in
conjunction with the `OpenID Federation Research and Education Implementation Profile` document
to gain a full understanding of the OpenID4RS project.
