# OpenID Federation R&S Implementation Profile

The following presents a general architecture for a trust model
based on OpenID Federation, specifically tailored for the
Research and Scholarship ecosystem,
according to the pricinples and components defined in the document
[General Architecture](OpenID4RS-General-Architecture.md).

In this model, trust is established and managed through a federated system,
leveraging the OpenID Federation protocol. This protocol enables secure and
seamless communication between various independent entities, such as
research institutions, libraries, publishers, and data repositories.

The architecture is designed to facilitate trust and interoperability
between these entities, allowing them to share resources and collaborate
effectively. It does so by defining and enforcing policies for
identity verification, access control, and data protection.


## Scope of this Document

The standard utilized within this architecture is OpenID Federation 1.0. For detailed specifications, please refer to the official documentation available at [OpenID Federation 1.0 Specifications](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html).

This document serves as an implementation profile, fully compliant with the OpenID Federation specification, aimed at providing an implementation guide and defining implementation details for use cases specific to the research and scholarship community.


## Terminology

All terms used are defined within the
[OpenID Federation 1.0 Specifications](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html)


## Components and Roles

All components and entity roles mentioned in this document are defined in the OpenID Federation specification. This document does not introduce any additional components but specifies the implementation characteristics for each component, as necessary for the Research and Scholarship profile.

The components used in this specification, as defined in OpenID Federation, are the ones below:

- 

## Entity Configuration
## Entity Statement
## Trust Marks
## Intermediates
## Trust Negotiation
## Federation Endpoints
## Differences between OpenID Federation 1.0 and OpenID4RS
## Security Considerations and Current Best Practices
## Become an Identity Provider
## Become a Relying Party

The Research and Scholarship (R&S) ecosystem is a network, 
characterized by relationships between various entities. 
These entities, which include research institutions and other stakeholders, 
interact in ways that create a web of trust relationships.

In this context, managing trust becomes a challenge, especially considering 
the delegation mechanisms and the transitive nature of trust. Delegation 
refers to the process where an entity assigns certain responsibilities to 
another entity. Transitivity, on the other hand, allows an entity to trust 
another entity indirectly, through their mutual trust in a third entity.

This document introduces the OpenID4RS project, which proposes a solution 
to these challenges. It presents an architecture that leverages OpenID 
Connect and OpenID Federation to create a scalable trust model. This model 
is designed to handle the complexities of the R&S ecosystem, including 
delegation and transitive trust.
