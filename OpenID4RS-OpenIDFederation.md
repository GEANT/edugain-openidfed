# OpenID Federation R&S Implementation Profile

The following presents a general architecture for a trust model
based on OpenID Federation, specifically tailored for the
Research and Scholarship ecosystem,
according to the pricinples and components defined in the document
[General Architecture](OpenID4RS-General-Architecture.md).

In this model, trust is established and managed through a federated system,
leveraging the OpenID Federation protocol. This protocol enables secure and
seamless communication between various independent entities, such as
research institutions, libraries, publishers, and data repositories.

The architecture is designed to facilitate trust and interoperability
between these entities, allowing them to share resources and collaborate
effectively. It does so by defining and enforcing policies for
identity verification, access control, and data protection.

At the heart of this architecture is the concept of a Trust Chain,
a series of signed artifacts that represent the relationships and
permissions between entities. This chain is built and maintained
through a process known as Federation Entity Discovery.

The model also incorporates optional Trust Marks, which federations
can define and require based on their specific needs. These marks
serve as additional indicators of trustworthiness within the ecosystem.

This architecture aims to provide a robust and flexible framework
for establishing trust in the research and scholarship ecosystem, promoting
collaboration and resource sharing while ensuring security and privacy.
