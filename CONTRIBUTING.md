# Contributing to OpenID for Research and Scholarship (OpenID4RS) Project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this
project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests,
as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html),
so All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood
to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug
by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
A great bug report is one that makes it easy for us to understand what you were
trying to do and what went wrong. Provide as much context as possible
so we can try to recreate the issue.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We recommend using a consistent coding style to ensure that the code is
easy to read and understand.
