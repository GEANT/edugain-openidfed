# OpenID for Research and Scholarship (OpenID4RS) Project

This project aims to establish a trust model for the Research and Scholarship (R&S)
ecosystem using OpenID Connect and OpenID Federation specifications.
The goal is to facilitate secure and seamless communication between
various independent entities in the R&S ecosystem, such as research institutions,
libraries, publishers, and data repositories.

## Documentation

The project includes the following documents:

- [OpenID4RS General Architecture](./OpenID4RS-General-Architecture.md): This document provides a general architecture for the trust model.
It defines the basic principles behind the trust model, provides a high-level and detailed description of the architecture,
and discusses practical considerations for implementation.

- [OpenID4RS Federation](./OpenID4RS-OpenIDFederation.md): This document discusses the role of OpenID Federation in the trust model.
It explains how OpenID Federation enables the establishment and maintenance of Trust Chains, and the optional use of Trust Marks.

- [OpenID4RS Connect](./OpenID4RS-OpenIDConnect.md): This document focuses on the use of OpenID Connect in the trust model.
It explains how OpenID Connect facilitates identity verification and secure communication between entities in the R&S ecosystem.

- [OpenID4RS Technical Rules, Policies and Constraints](./OpenID4RS-Rules-Policies-and-Constraints.md): This document provides a detailed
definition of the policies and artifacts in the OpenID4RS trust model, with a focus on the categories of intermediates,
federation constraints, and entity categories as trust marks.


Each document is intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of the different aspects of the trust model.
They should be read in conjunction to gain a full understanding of the project.
