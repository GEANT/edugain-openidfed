# General Architecture of the OpenID for Research and Scholarship
This document defines the general architecture for a trust model based on
OpenID Federation, specifically tailored for the research and scholarship ecosystem.

In this model, trust is established and managed through a federated system,
leveraging the OpenID Federation protocol. This protocol enables secure
and seamless communication between various independent entities, belonging to different and indpendent organizations.

## 1. Introduction
This section provides an overview of the document, its purpose, and the problem it aims to address.

# General Architecture of the OpenID for Research and Scholarship

The Research and Scholarship (R&S) ecosystem is a complex network, 
characterized by intricate relationships between various entities. 
These entities, which include research institutions and other stakeholders, 
interact in ways that create a web of trust relationships.

In this context, managing trust becomes a challenge, especially considering 
the delegation mechanisms and the transitive nature of trust. Delegation 
refers to the process where an entity assigns certain responsibilities to 
another entity. Transitivity, on the other hand, allows an entity to trust 
another entity indirectly, through their mutual trust in a third entity.

This document introduces the OpenID4RS project, which proposes a solution 
to these challenges. It presents an architecture that leverages OpenID 
Connect and OpenID Federation to create a scalable trust model. This model 
is designed to handle the complexities of the R&S ecosystem, including 
delegation and transitive trust.

### 1.1 Purpose of the Document

This architecture aims to provide a robust and flexible framework
for establishing trust in the Research and Scholarship ecosystem,
promoting collaboration and resource sharing while ensuring security and privacy.

The primary purpose of this document is to delineate a clear pathway for the
analysis of requirements and design considerations necessary to inform the
decisions and definitions that underpin a trust model for the Research and
Scholarship (R&S) ecosystem. It aims to provide a structured approach to
understanding the intricate trust relationships and to design an underlying
infrastructure that can support and scale these relationships effectively.

By dissecting the requirements, this document seeks to identify the key
elements and functionalities that the trust infrastructure must incorporate.
It will explore the necessary policies, protocols, and technologies that
enable entities within the R&S ecosystem to establish and maintain trusted
relationships.

Furthermore, the document will outline the design principles that should
guide the development of the trust model. This includes the articulation of
how trust can be delegated and transitive trust can be managed, ensuring
that the trust model remains robust, flexible, and scalable.

The ultimate goal is to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive framework
that will guide the implementation of a trust model, facilitating secure,
efficient, and collaborative exchanges within the R&S ecosystem.

### 6.1 Component Details
### 6.2 Contribution to the Trust Model

## 7. Trust Chain
At the heart of this architecture is the concept of a Trust Chain, a
series of signed artifacts that represent the relationships and
permissions between entities. This chain is built  through a discovery
process. This section explains the concept of the Trust Chain, how it is
established and maintained, and its role in the trust model.

### 7.1 Concept of the Trust Chain

At a high level, the Trust Chain operates on the principle of transitive trust,
facilitated by a trusted third party common to all participating independent organizations.

In this model, each organization trusts the third party, often referred to as a Trust Anchor.

When Organization A wants to establish a trust relationship with Organization B,
it relies on the Trust Anchor, which both A and B trust. If the Trust Anchor or its descendant Intermediates vouches for B,
then A can trust B implicitly, even without direct interaction.

This principle allows for the creation of a Trust Chain, where trust is passed
along a chain of organizations, all linked by their common trust in the Trust Anchor.
This chain can extend to any number of organizations, allowing for a scalable
and efficient trust model.

This model reduces the complexity and overhead of establishing trust relationships
between numerous independent organizations, as each organization only needs to
establish and maintain a trust relationship with the Trust Anchor, rather than
with every other organization individually.

as additional indicators of trustworthiness within the ecosystem.
