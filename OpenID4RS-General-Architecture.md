# OpenID R&S General Architecture

This document defines the general architecture for a trust model
specifically tailored for the research and scholarship ecosystem.

In this model, trust is established and managed through a federated system,
enabling secure
and seamless communication between various independent entities,
such as research institutions, libraries, publishers, and data repositories.

The architecture is designed to facilitate trust and interoperability
between these entities, allowing them to share resources and collaborate
effectively. It does so by defining and enforcing policies for identity
verification, access control, and data protection.
